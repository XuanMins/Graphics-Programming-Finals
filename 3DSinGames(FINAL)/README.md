# About my project
    Step1: A grid of tiles of the right size, spread over the right area, has been produced.
    Step2: Correct material and stroke is on display.
    Step3: Structure is wavy like the demo at the top of the page.
    Step4: Camera flies around like in the demo at the top of the page.
    Step5: Confetti appear on top of the structure like in the demo, at random locations and random angles, but do not necessarily animate.
    Step6: Confetti is falling downwards and is also rotating. When it reaches 0 on the y axis it resets to the top.
    Step7: Has the student implemented ideas for further development?
        -> Change from normalMaterial -> specularMaterial
        -> Add poinLight
        -> Add sliders for speed and height of wave
        -> First slider - wave speed
        -> Second slider - wave height
