    Step 1: Sepia filter has been implemented successfully and images look very similar to the ones provided by the instructor.
    Step 2: Vignetting has been achieved using the map() and constrain() functions (code check required) and results look very similar to the ones      
            provided by the instructor.
    Step 3: Radial blur has been achieved using the map() and constrain() functions (code check required). Clicking on the face of the boy in the colour 
            image replicates the results provided by the instructor.
