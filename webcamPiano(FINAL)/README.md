# About the project
    Step 1: Renaming of backImg to prevImg has taken place. 
    Step 2: Frame differencing implemented by moving prevImg around. 
    Step 3: Learner has included Grid.js correctly and grid activates with movement.
    Step 4: Learner has included blur in order to reduce the amount of noise that activates the grid.
    Step 5: Learner has scaled down images processed (currImg, diffImg) so that the sketch runs fast after blurring has slowed it down.
    Step 6: How much has the learner extended the sketch? Learner has included comments about the extension and shows understanding of techniques 
            learnt throughout the course.
        -> I changed the colours of the circles.
        -> I added more to create a ripple effect.
        -> I added notes, making it play sounds when the grid is activated.
        -> I implemented a custom “Note” class that is used in Grid.js. Instead of an array of values for noteSize, notePos and noteState i have 
           an array of notes.
